**About** :

We have performed **Exploratorary Data Analysis** on this dataset focused on **Heart Failure**, a critical medical condition characterized by the heart's inability to pump blood effectively, leading to inadequate circulation throughout the body.

The dataset encompasses 13 features, providing insights into the patients' health status and potential risk factors for heart failure.

**Features** :
